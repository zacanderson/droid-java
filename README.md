This project focuses on beginner Java concepts, such as printing to the screen and reading user input.

The purpose of this project was to translate skills I have into Java, and play around with them a bit.

Eventually, I would like to update this program so the user will perform actions with a UI and have to recharge their
droid with battery stations, but this is on hold until I learn how to do that in Java :)
